# AAI Experiment 1

## Overview
This experiment demonstrates the use of the **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**, a probabilistic model that serves as the foundation for generative model training. The experiment involves training the GMM on simple voice command data, enabling the model to learn the underlying distribution of the training data effectively.
